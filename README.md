## App Brainstorming (Step 4)

### MacroFactor
- Robust calorie and macronutrient tracking
- Algorithmically determines calorie expenditure from calorie intake and weight data
- Premium user model (no ads)

### Pocketcasts
- Repository of all or almost all popular podcasts
- Ability to queue podcasts
- Ability to autodownload new episodes

### Telegram
- End-to-end encryption
- Cloud-based messaging
- Stickers and animated emojis

### Discord
- Voice calls
- Large diversity of communities


### App Idea
My idea for an app is to build on Macrofactor to implement more features that fitness-minded individuals would use and appreciate. Right now, fitness functionality is split up between several different apps where a person might have a food tracking app (such as Macrofactor) and a separate weightlifting tracking app, and a third app for wearable integration. It would be beneficial and convenient for more features from other apps to be integrated into a nutrition tracking app so the user would experience less context switching. Such an app would be a one-stop-shop for nutrition tracking, workout tracking (e.g. weight-lifting sets+reps) as well as wearable integration, like tracking a run on Apple Watch for example. I believe that nutrition and exercise go hand-in-hand and so a singular app for both would be a useful tool for many people.
